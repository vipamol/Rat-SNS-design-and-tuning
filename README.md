# Rat-SNS-design-and-tuning
Modular Creation of Synthetic Nervous System for Rat Hindlimb
-------------------------------------------------
This project is the neural controller part of Rat simulation walking porject.
Firstly My idea is to creat a design tool to modular creating the SNS for legged
animal with GUI (in Matlab app designer), and even wrote proposal and certain 
part of the paper. But my PI doesn't like it and we are not CS person.

Thus, the focus is on the dynamic system of the CPG, wide exploring.
